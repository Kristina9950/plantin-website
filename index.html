        <h2>Before we reveal all Plantin's marketing secrets, we firstly need to tell you</h2>
        <h3>who is Christophe Plantin</h3>
      </div>

      <p>Born in 1520 in France, Christophe Plantin didn't start life with grand plans to become a pioneer in the printing world.
      In fact, his journey began simply—he was a <strong>bookbinder by trade</strong>. But, In 1555, Plantin, along with his wife, and their
      daughters, <strong>moved to Antwerp</strong>, a city buzzing with commerce and new ideas. There, he <strong>established the Plantin Press</strong>, a
      small printing operation that would eventually grow into one of the most renowned publishing houses in Europe.</p>

        <h2>It is also important to answer the question of the</h2>
        <h3>why Marketing Genius</h3>
      </div>

      <p>Plantin didn't have a grand plan, but he had an <strong>eye for opportunity</strong>. At the time, books were highly valued, but Plantin
      saw something more—they weren't just tools for learning or religious devotion, they could be <strong>symbols of power, prestige,
      and culture.</strong></p>
      <p>Rather than just meeting demand, Plantin anticipated it, tapping into the desire for books that reflected sophistication
      and intellect.</p>
      <img width="100" height="100" src="/src/assets/genius-frame.png" alt="genius frame" class="genius-frame">
      <p>It was this ability to <strong>spot, seize, and capitalize on opportunities</strong> that transformed Plantin's printing press into a
      respected brand. His success came not from a formal strategy, but from his natural ability to spot what people wanted,
      even before they knew it themselves.</p>
      <p><strong>That's what makes him a marketing genius.</strong></p>
